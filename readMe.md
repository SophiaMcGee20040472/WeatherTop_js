Brief description of the WeatherTop App developed:

I have created a simple design using a grey on the dashboard for background colour. On my dashboard I display recent weather Conditions and a Map where you can enter your latitude and longitude which will then be pin pointed on the map using OpenWeather Maps. You can add view new stations on this page.

In my station you can add and delete readings, you can also auto generate readings that are then displayed on a table of readings and a simple trends graph. I am carrying on the grey theme in which i had on dashboard. I have added an added feature where you can edit your readings as well. The cards update the last weather conditions along with finding the min, max and trends of some.

I also have an edit user page which you can change all your info including your name,email and password. You can sign up as a new User and login also and start adding your own stations and readings which will be saved to your own profile.
